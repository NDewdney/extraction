MESME Multi-word extractor project

Mesme is a 2-stage finite-state engine and filter model MWE extractor for English with a focus on Social Media. It aims to extract Compund Nouns, Verb Particles and Light Verb Constructs.

Building the code has a dependency on the libSVM jar (see Chang, C.C., Lin, C.J.: Libsvm: a library for support vector machines. ACM Transactions
on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) 2 (2011) 27). libSVM.jar is available from https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ 
For convenience there is a copy here, but it is recommended that an up to date version should be used.

The code is for research purposes. No guarentees!
